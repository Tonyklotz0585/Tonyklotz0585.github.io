					<i>What is Kauai?
				</h2>
					<p>
						Kauai is an island in the Central Pacific, part of the Hawaiian archipelago. 
						It's nicknamed "the Garden Isle" thanks to the tropical rainforest covering 
						much of its surface. The dramatic cliffs and pinnacles of its Na Pali Coast 
						have served as a backdrop for major Hollywood films, while 10-mile-long Waimea 
						Canyon and the Nounou Trails traversing the Sleeping Giant mountain ridge are
						hiking destinations.

					<i>What is there to do?
				</h2>
					<p>
						Kauai is hiking paradise. There is no doubt about that. The Na Pali coast 
						has some of the most epic ridges and drop-offs in the world. 
						There are countless epic waterfall hikes and then there is the magical 
						Kalalau Trail along the coast.
